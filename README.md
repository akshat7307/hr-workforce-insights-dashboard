# hr-workforce-insights-dashboard
An end-to-end HR analytics solution built in Microsoft Excel to visualize workforce composition, performance trends, and attrition drivers. This project transforms raw, simulated HR data into an interactive decision-making tool.
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a professional HR analytics workflow—covering data ingestion, transformation, and visualization—to uncover patterns in employee engagement, workload, and retention.
## Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Excel: Core platform for the dashboard.
Power Query: Used for data cleaning, type conversion, and handling null values.
Power Pivot & DAX: Used for data modeling and calculating complex KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
Pivot Tables & Slicers: Used to create interactive, filterable visualizations.
## Key Metrics & KPIs
Headcount: Total active and historical employee count.
Financials: Average Salary across departments and roles.
Performance & Engagement: Average Performance Scores and Engagement Levels.
Work-Life Balance: Average Weekly Work Hours vs. Overtime frequency.
Retention: Cumulative Attrition Rate tracking.
## Dashboard Highlights
Workforce Composition: Breakdown of employees by department and role.
Performance Analysis: Distribution of performance ratings and departmental averages.
Engagement vs. Workload: A scatter/trend analysis comparing engagement scores against weekly hours.
Attrition Drivers: Analysis of how overtime and low engagement correlate with employee turnover.
## Workflow Summary
Extraction: Imported raw simulated dataset (2008–2024).
Transformation (Power Query): Cleaned data types, removed duplicates, and created conditional columns for categorization.
Modeling (Power Pivot): Built a data model to handle relationships and wrote DAX measures for consistent KPI reporting.
Visualization: Designed a user-friendly interface using Pivot Charts and Slicers for real-time filtering (e.g., by Year, Department, or Gender).
## Critical Insights & Notes
Note on Data Realism: This project utilizes simulated data. While most business dashboards show linear trends, this dataset reflects real-world complexities where factors like "Engagement" and "Weekly Hours" may not always have a perfect correlation. These anomalies serve as a reminder that HR insights are exploratory and often influenced by variables beyond the primary dataset.
### How to Use
Download the .xlsx file from this repository.
Open the file in Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended).
Use the Slicers on the left/top of the dashboard to filter the data by Department or Year.
Ensure Macros/Data Connections are enabled to view the Power Pivot model.
